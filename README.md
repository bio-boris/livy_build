# Summary

* You can use livy with an older version of scala and spark. The packaged version works only with scala 2.11 and comes with jars for 2.11
* You can compile for later versions, but python/setup.py is broken and requires a workaround, and is fixed in my fork
* Newer versions are untested and unsupported it seems. Is it abandonware?
